Skye Documentation
==================

Skye is no longer supported or maintained.  I created it to handle
specific use cases (see the Boost.ASIO support), but it proved easier
to use
[Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock)
than to write a completely separate mocking framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coryan/Skye.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coryan/Skye)

The Skye Mocking Framework provides tools to mock C++ functions and
classes using the 'Action -> Assertion' style.  Skye also supports
mocking of template member functions and has specialized components to
mock Boost.ASIO objects.

- Licensing details are found in the COPYING file.
